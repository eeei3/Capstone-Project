# Project Proposal
## Description
- The Game is written entirely in Python

For our major project, we would like to build a Pokémon turn based fighter game.
We envision the game to possibly run in terminal or in a GUI. 
If it is a GUI, then Tkinter
The game should allow for users to have Pokémon battles against the computer (hopefully other people). 
The game should include all Pokémon from every generation, with their typing and move sets
## Need to have list
- List of Pokémon
- Moves
- Player v Machine
- Critical Hit Chance
- Type advantages/disadvantages
- Damage stat
- Miss chance
- Text-Based (If no graphics)
## Nice to have list
- Graphics
- Sound Effects
- Items
- Player v Player
## Do similar projects exist?
Yes, numerous Pokémon style turn based fighters exist:

## Our target users
Our target users would be gamers and Pokémon enthusiasts.
